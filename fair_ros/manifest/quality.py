"""Data-quality assessment for a finished mission.

The real-robot runs repeatedly produced archives that *looked* saved but were
nearly worthless — no ROS context captured, or bags with an unusable clock. The
tool happily archived them and the problem was only discovered later. This module
turns "is this mission actually any good?" into one explicit verdict, used to
gate the save decision at ``mission_close`` and to mark degraded missions in the
index so they are findable afterwards.

Levels:
  - ``ok``       — nothing important is missing.
  - ``degraded`` — usable, but with gaps (some sensors, some recordings).
  - ``poor``     — core content is missing (no ROS context, or no usable
                   recordings); saving should be a deliberate choice.

"""Best-effort detection of whether the system clock is synchronised.

An unsynchronised clock (recording started before NTP/chrony stepped the time)
leaves rosbag2 messages stamped near the epoch. Such bags are effectively
unusable: ``ros2 bag play`` honours the timestamps and stalls on the resulting
~56-year timeline, and the data is worthless for any time-critical processing.

fair-ros checks this *before* recording so the operator can wait for sync rather
than discovering the problem after the mission (the dashcam should fail safe and
warn early). Detection is best-effort and must never raise: ``None`` means "I
couldn't tell", which callers treat as "don't nag".

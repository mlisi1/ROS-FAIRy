# Spec: CLI Commands

Exact behaviour of every `ros2 fair <verb>`. All terminal output uses `rich`
(panels, tables, prompts). Exit codes: `0` success, `1` user-facing failure
(plain-language message, no traceback), `130` on Ctrl-C.

Global rules:
- Plain language only. Never show topic names, exception text, or JSON to the
  operator in the normal flow. A `--debug` flag on every verb enables verbose
  logging to stderr for engineers.
- Confirmations default Yes `[Y/n]`; destructive actions default No `[y/N]`.
- Every verb that needs root-owned paths checks writability first and, if denied,
  says: "I don't have permission to write to <dir>. Run setup again, or ask your
  engineer." (setup creates `/var/fair-ros` group-writable by group `fair-ros`).

## `ros2 fair setup`

One-time, per-robot, run by an engineer (jargon is allowed here, and only here).
Idempotent: re-running shows current values as defaults.

Flow:

1. **Preflight** — check running as root or with sudo-able rights; check `ros2`
   on PATH; warn (not fail) if Docker absent.
2. **Robot questions** (rich prompts, defaults from existing yaml if present):
   1. Robot name — non-empty, ≤ 40 chars.
   2. Platform (make and model) — non-empty.
   3. Serial number / asset tag — non-empty.
   4. Owning organization — non-empty.
   5. Contact email — must match `^[^@\s]+@[^@\s]+\.[^@\s]+$`.
3. **Sensor loop** — "Add a sensor? [Y/n]" repeated:
   1. Sensor id (slug, `^[a-z0-9_]+$`, unique).
   2. Type — choice list: gps / lidar / camera / imu / sonar / other.
   3. Make and model — non-empty.
   4. Topic — must start with `/`; if ROS is running, offer live topic list as
      completion candidates; accept unknown topics with a confirmation.
   5. TF frame id — optional, Enter to skip.
   6. Calibration file path — optional; if given, must exist; records a
      `calibrations[]` entry named `<sensor_id>_cal` and links it.
4. **Review panel** — full summary table, "Write this configuration? [Y/n]".
5. **Write** `/etc/fair-ros/robot_identity.yaml` (mode `0644`, dir `0755`).
6. **Install service** — create `/var/fair-ros/{spool/bags,archive}` and the
   `fair-ros` group, copy the systemd unit, `systemctl daemon-reload`,
   `systemctl enable --now fair-ros-watchdog.service`, then verify the unit is
   `active` and the state file appears within 10 s.
7. Final panel: "Setup complete. fair-ros is now watching for recordings."

Validation failures re-ask the same question with a one-line reason; three
consecutive failures on one question abort setup cleanly.

## `ros2 fair mission_start`

The briefing wizard. Target: under 2 minutes. Writes
`/var/fair-ros/spool/mission_context.json`.

Preflight:
- Watchdog not running → warn but continue: "Background recording assistant
  isn't running — your answers will still be saved." (dashcam principle: never
  block the human).
- Existing `mission_context.json` in spool → "There's already an unfinished
  mission from <date> by <operator>. Start a new one and replace it? [y/N]".
  No = exit 0 untouched.

Questions (exactly these five, in this order):

| # | Prompt text | Field | Required | Skip |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "What's your name?" | `identity.operator_name` | 🔴 yes | Re-asked until non-empty. Default: previous mission's operator if any. |
| 2 | "In one sentence, what is this mission trying to do?" | `intent.goal` | 🔴 yes | Re-asked until non-empty. |
| 3 | "Where are you? (place name, e.g. 'Marsh Creek, north bank')" | `intent.location_name` | 🔴 yes | Re-asked until non-empty. |
| 4 | "What's the environment like? (e.g. outdoor, indoor, marine — press Enter to skip)" | `intent.environment` | no | Enter → `null`. |
| 5 | "Anything else worth noting? (press Enter to skip)" | `intent.notes` | no | Enter → `null`. |

Then: generate `mission_id` + `created_at`, write the JSON atomically, show a
closing panel: "Mission briefing saved. Start recording with: ros2 fair
mission_record".

---

## `ros2 fair mission_record`

Thin, safe wrapper around `ros2 bag record`.

Preflight:
- `ros2` reachable (ROS sourced) — else: "I can't find ROS 2. Make sure the
  robot software is started, then try again."
- Free space in spool ≥ 1 GiB — else warn and require explicit confirm.
- No `mission_context.json` → warn: "No mission briefing yet — recording will
  still work, and you'll be asked the briefing questions when you close the
  mission. Continue? [Y/n]".
- Watchdog not active → warn (recording still proceeds; context can be
  harvested late by the retry rule, but the warning is honest about it).

Subprocess (exact):

```
ros2 bag record --all
    --output /var/fair-ros/spool/bags/<mission_id or 'unbriefed'>_<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>
```

If `robot_identity.yaml` has an optional `recording.topics` list, that list
replaces `--all`; an optional `recording.storage` value (e.g. `mcap`) is passed
as `--storage`. Defaults: all topics, rosbag2's default storage.

Behaviour:
- rosbag2 stdout/stderr streamed to the terminal unmodified (this is the one
  place raw ROS output is acceptable — it is live diagnostics, not a message
  from fair-ros).
- Ctrl-C is forwarded as SIGINT to the child and `mission_record` waits for it
  to exit cleanly (rosbag2 needs it to write `metadata.yaml`), then prints:
  "Recording stopped. When the mission is over, run: ros2 fair mission_close".
- Child exits non-zero → "Recording stopped with a problem. The data captured
  so far is kept." Exit 1.

---

## `ros2 fair mission_close`

The single save/discard decision.

1. **Load** `harvest.json` + `mission_context.json` via `manifest/builder.py`.
   - Spool has no bags at all → "There's nothing recorded yet." Exit 1.
   - Watchdog currently RECORDING (per state file + bag dir activity) →
     "It looks like recording is still in progress. Stop it first (Ctrl-C in
     the recording window), then run this again." Exit 1.
2. **Fill gaps** — if any 🔴 required user field is missing (briefing skipped),
   ask the corresponding `mission_start` questions inline, same wording.
3. **Validate** via `manifest/validator.py`. Remaining failures print one
   plain-language line each and exit 1.
4. **Summary panel** (rich), in order:
   - Mission title line: goal, location, date.
   - Operator and robot names.
   - Recording: bag count, total duration ("42 minutes"), total size ("3.1 GB").
   - Sensors: one line per declared sensor with ✓ or a warning glyph.
   - **Warnings**, each as its pre-rendered `plain_text` from `health_warnings`,
     plus harvest-level warnings ("I couldn't capture the software versions
     because ROS wasn't reachable", "This robot hasn't been set up yet…").
5. **Decision** — "Save this mission? [Y/n]"
   - **Yes** → call `archive/assembler.py` with a rich progress bar (bags can be
     gigabytes). On success: "Mission saved: <archive dir name>". Spool is now
     empty. Exit 0.
   - **No** → "Throw away this recording and all its data? [y/N]"
     - Yes → delete spool contents, "Recording discarded." Exit 0.
     - No → "Nothing was changed — the recording is still in the spool." Exit 0
       (the operator can rerun mission_close later).
6. Assembly failure → spool left intact, plain-language error naming the cause
   (disk full, permissions), exit 1. Never half-archived (see `specs/archive.md`).

Warning-generation logic lives in `topic_health.py` (per-bag) and `builder.py`
(harvest-level); `ui/review.py` only renders pre-built strings.

---

## `ros2 fair mission_status`

Read-only, instant, no prompts. Renders one panel from `watchdog.state`,
spool contents, and `mission_context.json`:

- Assistant (watchdog): "watching" / "recording (started 14:03, 12 minutes
  ago)" / "wrapping up" / "not running" (PID dead or state file stale > 5 min
  heartbeat while RECORDING).
- Mission briefing: operator + goal, or "not started yet".
- Recording: active bag, size so far, "growing" indicator; or "none".
- Context captured: per harvest module, plain words ("software versions ✓",
  "robot description ✗ — will retry"). Modules: robot identity, computer
  details, Python environment, connected hardware, software versions and
  settings, robot description, container software. Glyphs: `✓` ok, `⚠` partial,
  `–` skipped ("not used on this robot"), `✗` failed/timeout ("will keep
  trying"). The `partial` state (`⚠`) applies to the Python environment and
  connected-hardware modules when some sources were unavailable.

`--json` flag emits the raw machine-readable status for scripts (the one
sanctioned JSON output, since its audience is scripts, not operators).

---

## `ros2 fair list`

Queries the SQLite index only (never scans the archive directory).

Default output: rich table, newest first.

| Column | Source |
|---|---|
| Date | `created_at`, local time, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` |
| Mission | `goal`, truncated 40 chars |
| Location | `location` |
| Operator | `operator` |
| Duration | humanised from `duration_s` |
| Size | humanised from `size_bytes` |
| ⚠ | `warning_count` (blank when 0) |

Options:
- `--operator <text>`, `--location <text>` — case-insensitive substring filters.
- `--since <YYYY-MM-DD>`, `--until <YYYY-MM-DD>`.
- `--limit <n>` — default 20; footer line "Showing 20 of 134 missions" when
  truncated.
- `--path` — adds the archive path column (for engineers copying data off).

Empty result: "No missions found." Index file missing: "No missions have been
saved on this robot yet."

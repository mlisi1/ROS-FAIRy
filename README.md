# fair-ros

[![CI](https://github.com/gdl-res/ROS-FAIRy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gdl-res/ROS-FAIRy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Make robotics field mission data **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, Reusable) with zero friction for the operator.

fair-ros works like a dashcam: a background watchdog notices when a rosbag
recording starts, silently captures the context around it (robot identity,
ROS graph, software versions, container digests, Python environment, connected
hardware, sensor health), and at the end of the mission asks the operator one
question: *save or discard?*

Saved missions become self-contained [RO-Crate](https://w3id.org/ro/crate)
archives — rosbags plus machine-readable JSON-LD metadata aligned to
schema.org and W3C SSN/SOSA — indexed locally in SQLite. No cloud, no
network, everything on the robot.

## Commands

```
ros2 fair setup            # one-time robot setup (engineer, needs sudo)
ros2 fair mission_start    # 5-question briefing, under 2 minutes
ros2 fair mission_record   # record (wraps ros2 bag record)
ros2 fair mission_close    # review summary, then save or discard
ros2 fair mission_status   # what is the assistant doing right now?
ros2 fair list             # table of saved missions
ros2 fair diff [A] [B]     # compare two missions, show only what changed
```

All verbs accept `--debug` for verbose logging to stderr.

`mission_close` accepts `--note TEXT` to attach post-mission notes without
an interactive prompt.

## What gets captured automatically

Every time a recording starts, the watchdog harvests:

| Source | What |
|---|---|
| `robot_identity.yaml` | Robot name, platform, serial number, declared sensors, calibration file paths |
| System info | Hostname, kernel, architecture, `$ROS_DISTRO` |
| **Python environment** | Interpreter path/version, all installed packages with version and editable-install flag, pip freeze snapshot |
| **Connected hardware** | USB devices (`lsusb`), PCI devices (`lspci`), video devices (`/dev/video*`, `v4l2-ctl`), serial devices (`/dev/ttyUSB*`, `/dev/ttyACM*`, `/dev/serial/by-id/*`), udev properties, filtered kernel messages |
| ROS graph | Node list, topic list with types, parameter dump, sensor liveness check |
| Docker containers | Image references, digests, Compose file snapshots |
| Robot description | URDF from `/robot_description`, TF static transforms |
| Bag health | Per-topic gap detection, low-rate warnings, plain-language summaries |

All harvest steps are read-only, non-invasive, and timeout-safe. Missing
commands (e.g. no `lsusb`) produce partial results, never failures.

## Archive layout

Each saved mission is a self-contained directory:

```
